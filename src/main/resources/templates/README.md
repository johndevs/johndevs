## ðŸ’¬ About me

I am *John Ahlroos*, a software engineer with a long history in building web applications and working with Open 
Source communities. 

I love coding and hacking away on projects, and over time I have also enjoyed leading teams and mentored younger 
developers. At heart though, I am a coder, through and through.

I come from as far north as Finland; you know where the northern lights shine, and the reindeer run wild on the 
streets... Don't you? <br/>
We Finnish developers are a humble bunch, we rarely brag about our abilities but are known for 
writing excellent and readable code that **just works**. We are hard workers and always speak up and 
take the lead when we see there is something that needs to be improved. 

In 2021 I made a big move and moved to the South coast of Spain, more specifically Marbella, and started working on a 
trading platform for [Skilling](https://skilling.com). I am still on that route today. ðŸŒ´

I also run a small one-man shop in my spare time when I freelance and do small web-projects from time-to-time. It is 
called Devsoap and you can find its webpage over [here](https://devsoap.com). If you need a webapp or something code 
related send me a message. I am always happy to help and if I canÂ´t, I have a network of ex-colleagues and generally 
good people I can refer you to.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

I have worked with many tech-stacks over the years and have tried to gather as much information about them here. 
For clarity though the most esoteric and historical stacks I have had the pleasure of working with are not 
listed as I cannot in good conscious recommend them to anyone.
